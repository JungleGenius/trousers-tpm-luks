#
# tpm-luks.conf - configuration file for tpm-luks PCR use
#
# The format of the entries in this file is:
# device:index:script
#
# device - a LUKS partition
#
# index - A TPM NVRAM index used to store the LUKS secret. You can list
#	  NVRAM indexes with tpm_nvinfo.
#
# script - full path to a script that produces a TPM NVRAM permissions file,
#	   as used by tpm_nvdefine -f. See tpm-luks-gen-tgrub2-pcr-values
#	   for info on the format of the script file.
#
# Note: all TPM NVRAM indexes must be different at the moment, until init,
#	update and dracut crypt-tpm module is rewritten to allow the use of
#	the same index for severall LUKS devices
#
#	to disable the use of TPM NVRAM PCR:
#	- use '' as script name (<device>:<index>:)
#
# example:
#
#/dev/sda2:1:@sbindir@/tpm-luks-gen-tgrub2-pcr-values
